"""Tests for the invitation-action owner.

The write gate is what most of these hold: the invite deeplink may only be
opened to submit once LinkedIn has exposed the vanityName invite anchor, and
the one other thing allowed to open it — the note-quota probe — never clicks
a primary button. Every case that reaches a decision drives the real
classifier from structural signals; no case reads a label.

``tests/test_action_signals_dom.py`` covers the other half, where the
programs run against a real DOM in four label sets. Here ``page.evaluate`` is
a mock, so the JS never executes and the signals are supplied directly.
