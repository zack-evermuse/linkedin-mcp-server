        data-thread attributes, and no embedded URNs — clicking each row and
        reading the resulting SPA URL is the only available extraction path.
        The inbox is used rather than `?searchTerm=` because LinkedIn's
        messaging search frequently returns "We didn't find anything" for a
        participant whose thread is plainly present in the inbox (issue #434).
        ``name_filter`` is passed to the enumerator so only the matching row is

        untouched.

        Matches by case-insensitive equality on the cleaned participant name
        derived from the row's aria-label, which tolerates duplicate threads
        with the same participant. Browser locale is forced to en-US so the

        a wrong-thread match. If the inbox scan finds nothing (a thread buried

        a last resort.

        For a participant with multiple threads, the returned set — and thus
        ``index`` selection in the caller — covers the threads visible in the
        scanned inbox; the search fallback only runs when the inbox scan is

        counts: a page rewriting its own address raises the same event and

        rather than comparing addresses, or a chain that returns to the route
